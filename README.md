Welcome to my portfolio project. This is where I will be portraying the skilss I have learnt and the projects I`ve done so far.

# About the Project
This project briefly showcases my skills and experience in HTML, CSS , Javascript basics. The goal of this project was to showcase my projects.
# Technologies Used
* HTML

# Challenges and Lessons Learned
During the development of this project I couldn`t quite figure how to put a humbugger menu. 
I will have to go through Javascript all over coz I am still a beginner.
# Future Development
I will add the hambugger menu for easy navigation in mobile devices.
# Insights and Help
I majorly learnt along in developing the project using Youtube Bedmicode developers as I was also trying to develop a long as I followed through their coding tutorials.
